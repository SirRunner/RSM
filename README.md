# RSM

Welcome to Random Stuff Mod, Random \*\*\*\* Mod! At the moment the mod is in early development. Currently, I am not taking any requests for additions except for military research. However, the idea, assuming that I make it to that point in development, is that you, the players, ask me to add something, regardless of how ridiculous or ahistorical it is, and I will attempt to add it to the best of my ability!

## Notes and Thanks
 - This mod is based upon NNM. As such, the Features will be written as if one knows *everything* that the mod offers, which I sincerely doubt anyone does, except perhaps the creators.
 - Both of the unit UI changes come from PDM
