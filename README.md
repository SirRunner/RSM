# RSM

Welcome to Random Stuff Mod, or if you prefer, Random \*\*\*\* Mod! At the moment the mod is in early development. Currently, I am taking requests specifically for research or flavor for the British Isles. However, the idea, assuming that I make it to that point in development, is that you, the players, ask me to add something, regardless of how ridiculous or ahistorical it is, and I will attempt to add it to the best of my ability!

This mod is made by SirRunner (both on Reddit and Discord - I do post a fair amount on Reddit and I occasionally participate in the V2 Modding Discord). However, not everything used by the mod is made by me.....

## Notes and Thanks
I feel obligated to note and thank the modders from whom I have, for lack of a better word, stolen some files/code...
 - This mod is based upon [NNM](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/hod-new-nations-mod.683896/). As such, the Features will be written as if one knows *everything* that the mod (NNM) offers, which I sincerely doubt anyone does, except perhaps the creators
 - Both of the unit UI changes come from [PDM](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/pop-demand-mod.562/)
 - I have integrated a slightly modified version of [Kwizzle's Utility Mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/kwizzles-utility-mod) (Utility Mod Decision and Events)
 - The army doctrine ideas I stole right off of Heart of Iron IV and a mod for that game, [Road to 56](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=820260968)
 - The base assimilation percentages (that can be seen by checking the POP tab) is a slightly modified version of those that the [Heirs to Aquitania](https://github.com/Savolainen5/The-Heirs-to-Aquitania) use
 - Many (but not all) of the cultures added and population changes that have occurred and some of the new social and political policies are from [HFM](https://github.com/SighPie/HFM)
 - The Research Funding reform is from [End of a New Beginning](https://github.com/team-eoanb/EoaNB/tree/master) a mod for HOI 4
 - Graphical changes are from [Mish Map Mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/mish-mash-map-mod)
