# RSM

Welcome to Random Stuff Mod, or if you prefer, Random \*\*\*\* Mod! At the moment the mod is in early development. Currently, I am not taking any requests for additions except for military research. However, the idea, assuming that I make it to that point in development, is that you, the players, ask me to add something, regardless of how ridiculous or ahistorical it is, and I will attempt to add it to the best of my ability!

This mod is made by SirRunner (both on Reddit and Discord - I do post a fair amount on Reddit and I occasionally participate in the V2 Modding Discord). However, not everything used by the mod is made by me.....

## Notes and Thanks
 - This mod is based upon NNM. As such, the Features will be written as if one knows *everything* that the mod (NNM) offers, which I sincerely doubt anyone does, except perhaps the creators.
 - Both of the unit UI changes come from PDM
 - I have integrated a slightly modified version of Kwizzle's Utility Mod (Utility Mod Decision and Events)
 - The army doctrine ideas I stole right off of Heart of Iron IV and a mod for that game, Road to 56
