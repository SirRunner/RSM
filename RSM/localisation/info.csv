EVT1000000DESC;Thank you for downloading RSM! I know these events can be tedious to read, but if you have not read this event yet, please, read it! Please note that the mod is in its early stages of development. Similarly, note that the only country to get a bunch of flavor is England. \n\nThe idea of the mod is to make many alt-history options within the historical timeline. In other words, the alt-history occurs because of your actions. Furthermore, if you have any ideas that you would want me to add, just tell me, and I will do my best to add them! Likewise, if you feel like something is not working correctly, let me know! There are channels setup in the Victoria II Modding Discord server. Here is a link for those who are not currently part of it but want to join it: https://discord.gg/EbY7qaA \n\nThanks for playing and have fun! \nSirRunner, mod creator;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT1000001DESC;Honestly, there has not been much added to the United Kingdom. There are some flavor additions, but those are just due to England getting them, and it made sense to also add them to the United Kingdom. The main addition to the United Kingdom is the Disunited Kingdom decision, which allows the complete dissolvement of the United Kingdom - Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and England are all release. Likewise, every colony is either given independence or to another great power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT1000002DESC;There have been many additions to England, almost all of which have been based around the United Kingdom taking the decision "The Disunited Kingdom". This blocks England from reforming the UK, however, it unlocks a much more powerful path... \n\n§WFeatures: \n§RThe Angevin Empire§B: A formable nation only available to England which easily has the potential to be the most powerful nation. It all begins with the coronation of Queen Victoria and the Norman War. \n§RPuppet Power§B: The path to the Angevin Empire allows England to take up to 6 vassals. Three of these can be gotten from unstability in France, a two more from "crises", and a sixth for a diplomatic insult. \n§RSmall Flavor§B: There are many small flavor additions added to England, all of which are shared with the Angevin Empire, and some of which are shared with the UK.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
