the_disunited_kingdom_desc;The United Kingdom is no longer working. Ever since their subjugation, the Irish have been plotting against the crown, attempting to break free. Secret meeting have been occurring in Wales and Scotland, conspiring to tear down everything our ancestors sacrificed to build. Everywhere, the United Kingdom's colonies prepare to rebel against her. Ourside the borders of the empire, her enemies plot against her. There is no stopping this wave of violence. \n\nIt may be possible for the empire to prevail against these internal cracks, but that is not our choice. Our choice is to save our sons for their true purpose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

returning_english_desc;With the global abdication of England's power, the question remains as to our policies surrounding the English settlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
irish_settlers_title;The Irish Settlers Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
irish_settlers_desc;Ireland is no longer under our kingdom. While they were, a number of Irish moved to our English provinces. What should be done about them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norman_princes_title;Norman Princes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norman_princes_desc;The current kings and queens of England are descendents of William the Conquerer. William, and many know, was a Norman. Since his time as King, we have lost his homeland. \n\nNo longer. Today Queen Victoria announced a bold idea: retake England's ancestral homeland. To victory, or death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
english_channel_title;The English Channel Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
english_channel_desc;The English Channel has long separated what people normally refer to as England and France. Why is it called the ENGLISH channel. Clearly this means that all land that touches the channel is rightfully English. \n\nSince their defeat in what is now being called the Norman War, diplomatic relations with the French have soured to the point of no return. There is no way they would just give us the land - we will have to take it by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stabilize_france_title;Stabilize France;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stabilize_france_desc;The time has come. France is fracturing. Internal tensions are boiling. Soon, France will collapse. Members of our inner circle are urging us to take this opportunity, and so we shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_french_question_title;The French Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_french_question_desc;It has been a number of years since France was defeated. We have provided stability to the region. There are beginning to be international questions about our prolonged occupation of French lands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_angevin_empire_title;The Angevin Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_angevin_empire_desc;We have beat the French into the dust. Their nation no longer exists. Some may consider it archaic, but we hold much of the lands that the Angevins did in the twelth and thirteenth century. \n\nEngland no longer seems like the right name for our nation. We may be English, however, half of our land is French. Another name may be more suiting to our needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
agv_french_integration_title;French Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
agv_french_integration_desc;After being confronted by the European community about our occupation of French lands, we informed that that we planned on fully integrating France into the Empire. Today is that day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100000DESC;\nIt has been some time since all English were living England. With our worldwide abdication of all of our colonies, they are no longer welcome in their homes. They became refugees persecuted in their former lands. No longer. England has a home for all English!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100001DESC;\nWith our claim to Normandy officially recognized, who could doubt its true ownership now? We are the descendents of the Normans. Normandy is our birthright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100002DESC;\nWe have been globally embarassed. Not only have we failed in our task given to us by our Queen, but we failed to the French. This embarrassment will stain our honor for all time..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100003DESC;\nThe English channel is now ours. France has been put in their place. In fact, it appears that their once powerful nation may be starting to fracture. National movements are appearing to form in their colonies, and more importantly, in Occitania and Alsace. \n\nShould they destabilize any farther, it may be our sovereign duty to "stibalize" them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100004DESC;\nWe have been disgraced! Not only have we failed to secure the English Channel, but we have lost our holdings in Normandy. This may be the end of our empiric aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100005DESC;\nWe have been given a most curious offer. Today some of our advisors met with some individuals claiming to be the leaders of dissident groups in Occitania, Alsace and Corsica. Their offer is rather simple, monetary support for puppet states. \n\nThe French Empire has been fracturing. Abroad they are appearing to face constant revolts in their colonies. Now, it appears that their European land will quickly follow suit. Even if we do not accept the offer, it may be time for English intervention in France...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100007DESC;\nWe have won the war against France. When the leaders of Occitania, Alsace and Corsica asked for help, we gave them it. As per the agreement we made, they have offered to be autonomous dependencies of the English crown. Do we follow through with our deal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100008DESC;\nAfter a number of requests from the European community, we should make a final decision regarding the French lands we have occupied under the guise of "stabilization". We have a number of options. Regardless of our choice, we should be able to convince the community to solely recognize our claims to the Channel-adjacent regions of Brittany, Normandy and Picardy. \n\n§RThe first and the last two options are rather self explanatory as to what they do. The second option unlocks the path to accepting French as an accepted culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100009DESC;\nNow that the French have taken their rightful place as equals within English society, their concerns are our concerns; their claimed land is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100011DESC;\nAs we are now freed from the British, there are a number of questions and trials we must face. One of them is the question of the British settlers that have come to our lands. What should we do about them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
