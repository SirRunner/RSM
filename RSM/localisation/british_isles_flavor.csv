the_disunited_kingdom_desc;The United Kingdom is no longer working. Ever since their subjugation, the Irish have been plotting against the crown, attempting to break free. Secret meeting have been occurring in Wales and Scotland, conspiring to tear down everything our ancestors sacrificed to build. Everywhere, the United Kingdom's colonies prepare to rebel against her. Ourside the borders of the empire, her enemies plot against her. There is no stopping this wave of violence. \n\nIt may be possible for the empire to prevail against these internal cracks, but that is not our choice. Our choice is to save our sons for their true purpose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

english_channel_title;The English Channel Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
english_channel_desc;The English Channel has long separated what people normally refer to as England and France. Why is it called the ENGLISH channel. Clearly this means that all land that touches the channel is rightfully English. \n\nSince their defeat in what is now being called the Norman War, diplomatic relations with the French have soured to the point of no return. There is no way they would just give us the land - we will have to take it by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

become_angevin_empire_desc;We have beat the French into the dust. Their nation no longer exists. Some may consider it archaic, but we hold much of the lands that the Angevins did in the twelth and thirteenth century. \n\nEngland no longer seems like the right name for our nation. We may be English, however, half of our land is French. Another name may be more suiting to our needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

secure_northern_continental_border_desc;Since our victory in the Alsace Crisis, the Germans have united, and have the potential to be a substantial threat. We ought to nip that in the bud. \n\nOur border with the Germans is rather short. However, talks with some military officials yields fears that they will march through Belgium, completely circumventing our defensive fortifications. We should create a puppet state in this region due to its strategic importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_rhineland_puppet_desc;We have achieved victory against the Germans, Belgians and Dutch! As such, now have the ability to create our defensive puppet to help us in the defense against Germany. There is no doubt they will proove handy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100000DESC;\nIt has been some time since all English were living England. With our worldwide abdication of all of our colonies, they are no longer welcome in their homes. They became refugees persecuted in their former lands. No longer. England has a home for all English!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100001DESC;\nWith our claim to Normandy officially recognized, who could doubt its true ownership now? We are the descendents of the Normans. Normandy is our birthright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100002DESC;\nWe have been globally embarassed. Not only have we failed in our task given to us by our Queen, but we failed to the French. This embarrassment will stain our honor for all time..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100003DESC;\nThe English channel is now ours. France has been put in their place. In fact, it appears that their once powerful nation may be starting to fracture. National movements are appearing to form in their colonies, and more importantly, in Occitania and Alsace. \n\nShould they destabilize any farther, it may be our sovereign duty to "stibalize" them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100004DESC;\nWe have been disgraced! Not only have we failed to secure the English Channel, but we have lost our holdings in Normandy. This may be the end of our empiric aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100005DESC;\nWe have been given a most curious offer. Today some of our advisors met with some individuals claiming to be the leaders of dissident groups in Occitania, Alsace and Corsica. Their offer is rather simple, monetary support for puppet states. \n\nThe French Empire has been fracturing. Abroad they are appearing to face constant revolts in their colonies. Now, it appears that their European land will quickly follow suit. Even if we do not accept the offer, it may be time for English intervention in France...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100007DESC;\nWe have won the war against France. When the leaders of Occitania, Alsace and Corsica asked for help, we gave them it. As per the agreement we made, they have offered to be autonomous dependencies of the English crown. Do we follow through with our deal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100008DESC;\nAfter a number of requests from the European community, we should make a final decision regarding the French lands we have occupied under the guise of "stabilization". We have a number of options. Regardless of our choice, we should be able to convince the community to solely recognize our claims to the Channel-adjacent regions of Brittany, Normandy and Picardy. \n\n§RThe first and the last two options are rather self explanatory as to what they do. The second option unlocks the path to accepting French as an accepted culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100009DESC;\nNow that the French have taken their rightful place as equals within English society, their concerns are our concerns; their claimed land is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100011DESC;\nAs we are now freed from the British, there are a number of questions and trials we must face. One of them is the question of the British settlers that have come to our lands. What should we do about them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100011OPT3;These settlers are $COUNTRY_ADJ$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100013DESC;\nDespite losing control of Ireland, there are still a number of Irish citizens living in England. What should we do with them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100014DESC;\nToday, the University of London has been founded. Undoubtedly this will have many effects on our population over time. Let all who come by merit deserve the most reward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT100019DESC;\nToday, the first light festival occurred in Blackpool. Aptly named the Blackpool Illuminations, this festival may end up being an annual event, attacting visitors from around the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100020DESC;\nIn the past couple weeks, a new print novel has become widespread: the stories of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle. The stories depict a detective, understanding and bringing order to a chaotic world. Perhaps we should follow his example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100021DESC;\nWhen the United Kingdom was dismantled, the only culture group not granted their own state were the Cornish. Outraged, they filed a formal complaint that was promptly ignored. It seemed that they were content to stay part of England. \n\nNo longer. While the war for Normandy may be popular with the English, it by no means is popular with the Cornish. This has stirred growing nationalist sentiments into full out rebellion, which would should put down immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100022DESC;\nThe Cornish have been put down. Their rebellion was well timed, but they did not have the strength to prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100023DESC;\nThis is disastrous! Somehow, the Cornish were able to prevail, beating our glorious empire. This is an embarrassment to all English.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100025DESC;\nToday, we have received a letter from the government of $FROMCOUNTRY$, informing us of their decision to leave the empire. Inspired by the cultural nationalist movements spreading throughout Europe, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have the audacity to declare independence, despite their agreement to be our puppet state!\n\nWhat will be our response? We clearly cannot let this go unanswered. If were to accept their declaration of independence, our other puppets may see weakness in us. On the other hand, if we were to press our claims, we would face the ire of their cultural group, likely uniting them regardless of the outcome out the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT100032DESC;\nAfter months of secret talks between our governments, the free Celtic countries have agreed to unite under one nation to better weather the English threat. Early thoughts about unification began as soon as England claimed Normandy, and sped up as they also claimed the land bordering the English Channel. Finally, when England outright annexed France, claiming to "stabilize them", negotiations sped along at a rate no one was expecting. \n\nThis may provoke some diplomatic repercussions from the English, but we are stronger togther than we are apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
